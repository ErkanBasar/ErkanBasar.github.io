I was invited to give a talk at this year’s Research Strategy Day, organized by Radboud University Medical Center, on the significant impact of recent advancements in language modeling on the medical field. In my presentation, I showcased our ongoing work in developing conversational agents within a controlled framework. Together with the audience, we also discussed the potential benefits and challenges associated with the application of large language models in medical contexts and I have answered their questions to the best of my knowledge. The event was an invaluable opportunity for me to engage with researchers from the medical research center, facilitating an exchange of ideas on how the current artificial intelligence technologies can enhance or hinder medical practice and patient care.
