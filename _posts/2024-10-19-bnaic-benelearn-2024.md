I had the opportunity to speak and participate in a panel discussion at [BNAIC2024](https://bnaic2024.sites.uu.nl/), where we tackled topics surrounding the recent developments in the field of AI and their impact. My speech covered our work on employing large language models in predetermined chatbots within a controlled framework, along with the insights from our [recent evaluation study]({{ "/news/2024/hcllm-acl2024" | relative_url }}).

The conference is organized by Utrecht University with the support of the Benelux Association for Artificial Intelligence (BNVKI) and the Netherlands Research School for Information and Knowledge Systems (SIKS). The session I contributed to was arranged by Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence (ICAI).
