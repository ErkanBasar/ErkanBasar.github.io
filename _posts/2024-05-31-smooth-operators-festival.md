I have been invited to the [Smooth Operators Festival](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/activities/smooth-operators-festival) to demonstrate our hybrid long-term conversational agents that we have developed through collaborations within the [Look Who's Talking](https://look.uvt.nl) project for smoking cessation and sexual health promotion. The event is organized by the [Smooth Operator](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/projects/smooth-operator-development-and-effects-of-personalized-conversat) project members and held on May 31 in Tilburg, The Netherlands.
