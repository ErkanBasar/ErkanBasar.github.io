I have been invited to the [NLG in Lowlands](https://sites.google.com/view/nlg-in-the-lowlands-2024) workshop this year to present a poster on the results of our recent study on human evaluation of motivational interviewing-style reflections generated by large language models. The workshop provides a platform for researchers from Germany, the Netherlands, and nearby regions to share and discuss current research in the field of Natural Language Generation. It will take place on June 12, 2024, in Bielefeld, Germany.
