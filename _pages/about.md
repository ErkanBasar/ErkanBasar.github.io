I am a computer scientist specializing in AI and machine learning, with a focus on language technologies. My work is aimed at advancing research in AI and its practical applications. I enjoy working in multidisciplinary environments, collaborating with experts across various domains to bring innovative and effective solutions to complex challenges.

Currently, I work as a PhD candidate in [Behavioural Science Institute](https://www.ru.nl/en/bsi) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en). In my research, I focus on developing and evaluating intelligent conversational agents that support health counselling by using natural language processing methods and technologies, including large language models, as part of the multidisciplinary [Look Who's Talking](https://look.uvt.nl) project.

I obtained my master's degree from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en) in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/masters/artificial-intelligence), and my bachelor's degree from [Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University](https://mu.edu.tr/en) in [Computer Engineering](https://bilgisayar.mu.edu.tr/en). Shortly after, I have worked as an AI engineer and computational linguist at FloodTags where I have developed information systems that process textual data to collect critical information about natural disaster events in real-time from online social and mainstream media.
